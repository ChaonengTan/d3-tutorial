# Groups

Group is an SVG element that allows you to group other elements together. 

A group is a tag like `<circle>` and `<ellipse>`. The group tag looks like this: `<g>`. 

What is a group used for? Grouping other elements together! A group is a container element. That is doesn't display anything itself but displays all of it's children. 

You can apply properties to the group and all children will inherit those properties.
